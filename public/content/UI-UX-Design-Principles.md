Creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences is essential for modern web and mobile applications. This guide covers the fundamental principles of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design to help you build user-friendly products.

## What is UI/UX Design?

**User Interface (UI)** focuses on the visual aspects of a digital product, including layout, colors, typography, and interactive elements.
